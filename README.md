JVM-C2 is a Java-based Command &amp; Control (C2) framework designed for stealth, flexibility, and cross-platform operation. Built entirely in Java, it leverages JVM-based evasion techniques, dynamic class loading, and in-memory execution to provide stealthy, fileless post-exploitation capabilities.
