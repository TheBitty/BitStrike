# BitStrike
BitStrike-C2 is a Java-based Command &amp; Control (C2) framework designed for stealth, flexibility, and cross-platform operation. Built entirely in Java, it leverages JVM-based evasion techniques, dynamic class loading, and in-memory execution to provide stealthy, fileless post-exploitation capabilities.

Features Planned:

✔ Cross-Platform – Runs on Windows, Linux, and macOS via JVM.
✔ Fileless Execution – In-memory payload injection using custom ClassLoaders.
✔ Encrypted C2 Comms – Secure communication with TLS/SSL/WebSockets.
✔ Modular & Extensible – Easily extend with custom payloads & plugins.
✔ Evasion Techniques – Bypasses traditional AV/EDR detection with dynamic execution.

# BitStrike: Legal & Ethical Usage

## Project Purpose Statement

BitStrike is developed solely for **educational and security research purposes**. This Java-based Command & Control (C2) framework is intended to:

1. Demonstrate security concepts in a controlled environment
2. Provide a learning platform for understanding post-exploitation techniques
3. Enable authorized penetration testers to simulate advanced persistent threats
4. Advance the knowledge of defensive countermeasures against C2 infrastructure

## Legal Disclaimer

This tool is provided for legitimate security research and education only. The developers of BitStrike:

1. Do not condone, encourage or support any unauthorized access to computer systems
2. Expressly prohibit the use of this software for any illegal activities
3. Accept no responsibility for misuse of this software
4. Recommend usage only in controlled, isolated test environments

## Acceptable Use Cases

BitStrike may be legitimately used in:

- Academic research on defensive countermeasures
- Authorized penetration testing engagements (with explicit written permission)
- Educational demonstrations in cybersecurity courses
- Personal lab environments for learning security concepts

## Prohibited Use Cases

BitStrike may NOT be used for:

- Unauthorized access to any system you do not own or have explicit permission to test
- Any activity that violates the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) or similar laws
- Attacks against critical infrastructure, personal data, or sensitive systems
- Any activity intended to cause harm or disruption

## Built-in Safety Measures

To prevent misuse, BitStrike implements several safety measures:

1. Default configuration limited to localhost operations
2. Required explicit target confirmation before execution
3. Detailed audit logging of all activities
4. No automated exploitation capabilities
5. Payload execution requires manual authorization

## Responsible Disclosure

If you identify potential improvements to this tool or concerns about its implementation:

1. Please submit issues through the project's issue tracker
2. Contact the project maintainers directly for security concerns
3. Provide constructive feedback for enhancing the educational value
