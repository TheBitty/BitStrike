# BitStrike
BitStrike-C2 is a Java-based Command &amp; Control (C2) framework designed for stealth, flexibility, and cross-platform operation. Built entirely in Java, it leverages JVM-based evasion techniques, dynamic class loading, and in-memory execution to provide stealthy, fileless post-exploitation capabilities.

Features Planned:

✔ Cross-Platform – Runs on Windows, Linux, and macOS via JVM.
✔ Fileless Execution – In-memory payload injection using custom ClassLoaders.
✔ Encrypted C2 Comms – Secure communication with TLS/SSL/WebSockets.
✔ Modular & Extensible – Easily extend with custom payloads & plugins.
✔ Evasion Techniques – Bypasses traditional AV/EDR detection with dynamic execution.
